# heroes
Angular (4.0 - slight changes/improvements from AngularJS) 

Tour of Heroes + some integration into it from Advanced topics, so far mostly animations. Really not necessary since they provide examples but they're pretty much independent of work done during the tutorial.

Notes: 
-in src/app, mock-heroes files are no longer necessary once successfully moving to inMemoryWebApi
